//// SQLite Connection Management
////
//// Application boot needs to wire up database pools, cache
//// pools, and session stores, but the underlying config parsing
//// and pool construction are spread across several internal
//// modules. This module is the public entry point that ties
//// them together — each function takes a name or pool and
//// returns a ready-to-use resource, so the app's main module
//// reads as a simple sequence of start calls rather than
//// manual config loading and plumbing.
