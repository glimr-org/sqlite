//// SQLite Migration Database Operations
////
//// The console migration commands need to read which migrations
//// have already run and apply new ones, but that logic is
//// driver-specific — SQLite can't use Postgres-style dollar-
//// quoted statements and needs semicolon splitting for multi-
//// statement files. Keeping the SQL execution here separates
//// the database concerns from the console output and file
//// scanning in the action modules.
