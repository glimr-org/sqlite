//// SQLite Session Store
////
//// File-based sessions don't survive container restarts and
//// cookie sessions are limited to ~4KB. SQLite gives durable
//// server-side session storage without requiring a separate
//// database server — just a local file. Sessions are stored
//// as JSON payloads with a last_activity timestamp so
//// expiration is checked on read and stale rows are cleaned
//// up by GC without parsing the payload.
